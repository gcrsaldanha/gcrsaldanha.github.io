Hi!

This website does not have any specific purpose. For now, I'll use it to host personal projects.
Feel free to leave feedbacks about any project. You like it or not.
That's all! =)

For now, you can play with some interactive narrative projects that I made using Twine. Each project will soon have its own post describing its motivation and approached topics.
