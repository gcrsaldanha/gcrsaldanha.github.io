  An important topic in Interactive Narrative (and Narrative in general) is the
  understanding and recognition of *events*. The interaction user-media relies
  strongly on events along a narrative.

  The following project purpose is to transform a "regular" narrative into an interactive one by allowing the user to choose between events. Thus the narrative has multiple endings.

  The tool used was [Twine](https://twinery.org/) and the chosen narrative was Aesop's Fable: ["The Tortoise and the Eagle"](http://www.aesop-fable.com/tortoise/the-tortoise-and-the-eagle)

  To access the project, simple click on [this link]({{site.url}}/assets/twine/the-tortoise-and-the-eagle.html). It runs in the browser itself.

  If you know the fable (or just read it), you shold notice that a possible flow
  of the narrative is just like the original one.
